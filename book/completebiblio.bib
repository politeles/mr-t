  abstract = {When expressing their information needs in a (database) query, users
	sometimes prefer to state what has to be rejected rather than what
	has to be accepted. In general, what has to be rejected is not necessarily
	the complement of what has to be accepted. This phenomenon is commonly
	known as the heterogeneous bipolar nature of expressing information
	needs. Satisfaction degrees in regular fuzzy querying approaches
	are based on the â€˜symmetricâ€™ assumption that the extent to which
	a database record respectively satisfies and does not satisfy a given
	query are complements of each other and are therefore less suited
	to adequately handle heterogeneous bipolarity in query specifications
	and query processing. In this paper we present a bipolar query satisfaction
	modelling framework which is based on couples that consist of an
	independent degree of satisfaction and degree of dissatisfaction.
	The use and advantages of the framework are illustrated in the context
	of fuzzy query evaluation in regular relational databases. More specifically,
	the evaluation of heterogeneous bipolar queries that contain both
	positive and negative criteria is studied.}
