  abstract = {When expressing their information needs in a (database) query, users
	sometimes prefer to state what has to be rejected rather than what
	has to be accepted. In general, what has to be rejected is not necessarily
	the complement of what has to be accepted. This phenomenon is commonly
	known as the heterogeneous bipolar nature of expressing information
	needs. Satisfaction degrees in regular fuzzy querying approaches
	are based on the â€˜symmetricâ€™ assumption that the extent to which
	a database record respectively satisfies and does not satisfy a given
	query are complements of each other and are therefore less suited
	to adequately handle heterogeneous bipolarity in query specifications
	and query processing. In this paper we present a bipolar query satisfaction
	modelling framework which is based on couples that consist of an
	independent degree of satisfaction and degree of dissatisfaction.
	The use and advantages of the framework are illustrated in the context
	of fuzzy query evaluation in regular relational databases. More specifically,
	the evaluation of heterogeneous bipolar queries that contain both
	positive and negative criteria is studied.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a general discussion of the handling of imprecise
	and uncertain information in temporal reasoning in the framework
	of fuzzy sets and possibility theory. The introduction of fuzzy features
	in temporal reasoning can be related to different issues. First,
	it can be motivated by the need of a gradual, linguistic-like description
	of temporal relations even in the face of complete information. An
	extension of Allen relational calculus is proposed, based on fuzzy
	comparators expressing linguistic tolerance. Fuzzy Allen relations
	are defined from a fuzzy partition made by three possible fuzzy relations
	between dates (approximately equal, clearly smaller, and clearly
	greater). Second, the handling of fuzzy or incomplete information
	leads to pervade classical Allen relations, and more generally fuzzy
	Allen relations, with uncertainty. The paper provides a detailed
	presentation of the calculus of fuzzy Allen relations (including
	the composition table of these relations). Moreover, the paper discusses
	the patterns for propagating uncertainty about (fuzzy) Allen relations
	in a possibilistic way.},
