In Section \ref{sec:time-domain} an study about the time and its properties is done. Section \ref{sec:temporal-databases} is an overview of the main problems when managing the time in a database, the different proposals for solving them and the temporal database proposals. The section concludes with a comparison among the different proposals. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:fuzzy-temporal-databases} we present a sum up with the proposals for handling the imprecision in temporal databases and the main deficiences we have detected.
