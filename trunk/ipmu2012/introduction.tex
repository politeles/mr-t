There are several proposals in the literature for inferring uncertainty about sets from uncertainty about values. It is of particular interest for fuzzy temporal databases, the application on temporal intervals. The transformation from two ill-known temporal points to a ill-known set has been discussed in \cite{Garrido2009}. In this work we will analyze the major pitfalls of these approaches and the benefit of using the mechanism proposed in \cite{Pon11}.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, some preliminaries and concepts about the possibilistic evaluation framework and the temporal databases are presented. 
Section \ref{sec:proposal} presents the possibilistic model for valid-time databases.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusions} presents the main conclusions and some lines for the future work in this research.
