In~\cite{Pons2011}, the ill-known constraint framework is introduced. In this section, its main aspects concerning interval representation and Allen relationship evaluation are briefly presented.

\subsection{\label{subsec:ikc-preliminaries}Preliminary Concepts}
The IKC framework relies on the concepts of possibilistic variables, ill-known values and ill-known intervals. These are introduced below.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:poss-variable}
A \emph{possibilistic variable}~\cite{Dubois1988a},~\cite{Pons2011},~\cite{Billiet2012} $X$ on a universe $U$ is defined as a variable taking exactly one value in $U$, but for which this value is (partially) unknown. The variable $X$'s possibility distribution $\pi_X$ on $U$ models the available knowledge about the value that $X$ takes: for each $u \in U$, $\pi_X(u)$ represents the possibility that $X$ takes the value $u$.
\end{definition}

As mentioned above, possibility is interpreted as plausibility in the presented work and thus the possibility that possibilistic variable $X$ on $U$ takes the value $u \in U$ is interpreted as a measure of how plausible it is that $X$ takes the value $u$, given (partial) knowledge about the value $X$ takes.

Now consider a set $U$ containing single values (and not collections of values). When a possibilistic variable $X_{v}$ is defined on such a set $U$, the unique value $X_{v}$ takes, which is (partially) unknown, will be a single value in $U$ and is called an \emph{ill-known value} (IKV) in $U$ in this work~\cite{Dubois1988},~\cite{Pons2011},~\cite{Billiet2012}.

In this paper, possibilistic variables will be denoted using uppercase letters and IKV using lower-case letters.

\subsection{\label{subsec:ikc-interval}Representation of Time Intervals Subject to Uncertainty}
The IKC framework allows uncertainty in intervals by supporting a kind of ill-known intervals:

\begin{definition}
Consider an ordered set $U$. An \emph{ill-known interval} (IKI) in $U$ is an interval in $U$ of which both boundary values are ill-known values in $U$.
\end{definition}

Specifically with regards to time, an IKI in an ordered set of instants representing time is called an \emph{ill-known time interval} (IKTI) in the presented work. In this paper, an IKTI with starting instant $s$ and ending instant $e$ will be noted $\left[s, e\right]$.

\subsection{\label{subsec:ikc-evaluation}Evaluation of Allen Relationships}
At the base of the framework's approach to evaluating Allen relationships are ill-known constraints:

\begin{definition}
Given an ordered set $U$, an \emph{ill-known constraint} (IKC) $C$ on $U$ is specified by means of a binary relation $R \subseteq U^{2}$ and a fixed IKV $v$ in $U$ defined by its possibilistic variable $V$ on $U$, i.e.:
\begin{align}
C \triangleq (R,v) \nonumber
\end{align}
Any set $A \subseteq U$ now satisfies IKC $C = (R,v)$ if and only if:
\begin{align}
\forall a \in A : (a,v) \in R \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{definition}

The satisfaction of an IKC $C$ by a set $A$ will be noted $C(A)$ in this paper. 

Consider an ordered set $U$, an IKC $C \triangleq (R,v)$ on $U$ and a set $A \subseteq U$. Due to the uncertainty about the exact value of $v$, it is uncertain whether $A$ satisfies $C$ or not. Confidence about the plausibility that $A$ satisfies $C$ can be expressed using a possibility degree $\Pos(C(A))$ and a necessity degree $\Nec(C(A))$, which are shown to be calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
\Pos(C(A)) & = \min_{a \in A}\left(\sup_{(a,w) \in R}\pi_{V}(w)\right) \label{ill-known-pos}\\
\Nec(C(A)) & = \min_{a \in A}\left(\inf_{(a,w) \notin R} 1-\pi_{V}(w)\right) \label{ill-known-nec}
\end{align}

Given an ordered set $U$, possibility and necessity degrees expressing confidence about the plausibility that a set $A \subseteq U$ satisfies a boolean aggregation of IKC on $U$ can be found by using the possibilistic extensions of boolean operators `and' ($\wedge$), `or' ($\vee$) and `not' ($\neg$) and can be calculated using the following expressions:

\begin{align}
\Pos\left(\left(C_1(A)\right) \wedge \ldots \wedge \left(C_n(A)\right)\right) = \min_{i=1 \ldots n} \left(\Pos\left(C_i(A)\right)\right) \nonumber \\
\Nec\left(\left(C_1(A)\right) \wedge \ldots \wedge \left(C_n(A)\right)\right) = \min_{i=1 \ldots n} \left(\Nec\left(C_i(A)\right)\right) \nonumber \\
\Pos\left(\left(C_1(A)\right) \vee \ldots \vee \left(C_n(A)\right)\right) = \max_{i=1 \ldots n} \left(\Pos\left(C_i(A)\right)\right) \nonumber \\
\Nec\left(\left(C_1(A)\right) \vee \ldots \vee \left(C_n(A)\right)\right) = \max_{i=1 \ldots n} \left(\Nec\left(C_i(A)\right)\right) \nonumber \\
\Pos\left(\neg C(A)\right) = 1 - \Nec\left(C\left(A\right)\right) \nonumber \\
\Nec\left(\neg C(A)\right) = 1 - \Pos\left(C\left(A\right)\right) \nonumber
\end{align}

Here, $C$ and all $C_i$ for which $i \in \mathbb{N}_0$ and $1 \leq i \leq n$ denote IKC on $U$.

The IKC framework now allows evaluating a given Allen relationship $AR$ between a given crisp time interval $I$ and a given IKTI $J = \left[s, e\right]$ by allowing to calculate the possibility and necessity that $I$ $AR$ $J$ holds. For this, the combination of $AR$ and $J$ is translated to a specific boolean aggregation of specific IKC. These translations are shown in table \ref{tab:allen-relations}. Every row of this table corresponds to an Allen relationship. The Allen relationships the rows correspond to, are shown in the `Allen Relationship' column, the collections of specific IKC for given Allen relationships are shown in the `Constraints' column (every $C_i, i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ denotes an IKC) and the specific aggregation of these IKC used for evaluation of the Allen relationships are shown in column `Aggregation'. Finally, the possibility and necessity degrees expressing confidence about the plausibility that $I$ $AR$ $J$ holds are then the possibility and necessity expressing confidence about the plausibility that $I$ satisfies the specific aggregation of specific IKC found as translation of the combination of $AR$ and $J$.


Using the formulas shown above, the requested possibility and necessity degrees can be calculated from these.

% \end{figure}

%\begin{definition}
%An ill-known time interval \emph{(IKTI)} is defined by two ill-known values (see Figure \ref{fig:ill-known-ti}). Therefore, both starting and ending points are not precisely known. The following is the notation for an IKTI.

%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:ill-known-time-interval}
%J = \left[X, Y \right] 
%\end{align}

%Where both $X$ and $Y$ are ill-known time values.
%\end{definition}
%The Allen's Relations between a crisp time interval $I = [a,b]$ ($a, b$ are crisp time points) and an IKTI given by $J = [X,Y]$ ($X, Y$ are ill-known values, see Definition \ref{def:ill-known-value}) can be defined by using aggregations of ill-known constraints. Table \ref{tab:allen-relations} shows the corresponding ill-known constraints for each Allen's Relation. These ill-known constraints are aggregated by using the equations \eqref{and-ill-known-pos} to \eqref{not-ill-known-nec}.

%This section introduces the framework of the ill-known constraints. First of all, some preliminary concepts about possibility theory is explained. Next to that, the representation of time intervals by using the presented framework is done. Finally, the evaluation of the Allen's relationships between a crisp time interval and a possibilistic time interval is provided.
 
%\subsection{\label{subsec:possibilistic-variables}Possibilistic Variables}
%Informally speaking, a possibilistic variable is a variable that takes only one value but that, for some reason, this value is unknown. This is rather usual for historical events. For example, the conquest of Granada by the Christians' kings took place on February of 1492, but the exact day is not precisely known.
%A more formal definition of possibilistic variables is given as follows.
%Possibilistic variables rely on possibility theory \cite{Dubois1988a}. A \emph{possibilistic variable} is defined as follows \cite{Pons2011}.

%Now, for the exact form of the possibility distributions mentioned above, the IKC framework relies on fuzzy numbers~\cite{Dubois1983}~\cite{Billiet2012}:

%\begin{definition}
%A fuzzy interval is a fuzzy set~\cite{Zadeh1965} $M$, defined by a membership function $\mu_{M}$, on the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ such that:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\mu_{M} : &  \!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!  \!\!\!\!\!\!\! \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \left[0,1\right] \nonumber \\ 
%\label{eq:convexity}
%\forall (u,v)\in\mathbb{R}^2: \forall w \in [u,v]:& \\
%\nonumber
%\mu_M(w) \geq &  \!\!\! \min(\mu_M(u),\mu_M(v))  \\
%\label{eq:unicity}
%\exists m \in \mathbb{R} : &  \!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!  \!\!\! \mu_M(m)=1 
%\end{eqnarray}
%\end{definition}

%If this modal value $m$ is unique, then $M$ is referred to as a \emph{fuzzy number}~\cite{Dubois1983}~\cite{Billiet2012}. Towards representation, a very convenient form for the membership function $\mu_M$ of a fuzzy number $M$ is a triangular form. It can be shown that such $\mu_M$ with triangular form is convex and normalized, and thus can define a fuzzy number. Also, such $\mu_M$ (and thus $M$) can be defined by three values $a$ $M$ and $b$, where 
%TODO: references!

%Three real values, denoted by $a$, $b$ and $D$, suffice to represent a triangular membership function of a fuzzy number and in this work, a fuzzy number defined as such will be noted as $\left[D, a, b \right]$. Here $D$ is the core of $M$. $D-a$ and $D+b$ are respectively the lower and higher bounds of the possibility distribution.

%\begin{definition}
%\label{def:ill-known-value}
%A possibilistic variable~\cite{Dubois1988a},~\cite{Pons2011} $X$ over a universe $U$ is defined as a variable taking exactly one value in $U$. A possibility distribution $\pi_X$ on $U$ is defined and models the available knowledge about the value that $X$ takes: for each $u\in U$, $\pi_X(u)$ represents the possibility that $X$ takes the value $u$. In this work, this possibility is interpreted as a measure of how plausible it is that $X$ takes the value $u$, given (partial) knowledge about the value $X$ takes.
%\end{definition}

%TODO: iki is actually defined by possibilistic variable on set of intervals

%In an IKI, it can be uncertain which values are the exact bounding values of the interval. As a result, it can be uncertain which interval is the exact interval.%TODO: keep this sentence?

%The exact value a possibilistic variable takes, which is (partially) unknown, is called an \emph{ill-known value} in this work \cite{Dubois1988a}.

%An \emph{ill-known-set} \cite{Dubois1988a} is a possibilistic variable defined on the powerset $\Pow(U)$ of the universe $U$. 

%When a possibilistic variable is defined on the powerset $\Pow(R)$ of some universe $R$, the unique value the variable takes will be a crisp set and its possibility distribution on the powerset $\Pow(R)$ will describe the possibility of each crisp subset of $R$ to be the value the variable takes. This exact value (a crisp set) the variable takes, is now called an \emph{ill-known set} \cite{Dubois1988a}.


% A specific application of possibilistic variables is obtained when the universe under consideration is the set of Boolean values $\mathbb{B}$ = $\{T,F\}$. Indeed, any Boolean proposition $p$ takes just one value in $\mathbb{B}$. If the knowledge about which value this proposition $p$ will take is given by a possibility distribution $\pi_p$, the proposition can be seen as a possibilistic variable. As the interest lies with the case where the proposition holds, the possibility and necessity that $p$ = $T$ (the proposition holds) demand most attention. This possibility and necessity is noted here as:
% \begin{align}
% \text{Possibility that $p$ = $T$ (p holds):}  & Pos(p) = \pi_p(T) \label{propholdsposs} \\
% \text{Necessity that $p$ = $T$ (p holds):}  & Nec(p) = 1-\pi_p(F) \label{propholdsnecc}
% \end{align}

% This work will deal with ill-known intervals. These are ill-known sets, defined and represented via a start and end point, which will be ill-known values. The elements of the set are the values between the start and end point. A closed ill-known interval with start point defined by possibilistic variable $X$ and end point by possibilistic variable $Y$ is noted here $\left[X, Y\right]$. The correspondences and transitions between the representations of ill-known sets, between the representations of ill-known intervals and between the representations of an ill-known set and an ill-known interval are part of the authors current research.

%\subsection{\label{subsec:fuzzy-numbers}Fuzzy Numbers and Fuzzy Intervals}
%A fuzzy set is a set for which its elements have a degree of membership. Among others, Dubois and Prade~\cite{Dubois1983} use fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh1965} to define a \emph{fuzzy interval}:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% $D$ denotes the single value in the core of $M$
% \item
% $D-a$ is then $\inf \{u \in \mathbb{R} : \mu_{M}(u) > 0\}$
% \item
% $D+b$ is then $\sup \{u \in \mathbb{R} : \mu_{M}(u) > 0\}$

% \subsection{\label{subsec:ill-known-time-interval}Ill-known time intervals}
% The representation of an ill-known time interval is made by using two ill-known values. Therefore, both starting and ending points are not precissely known. Usually, a crisp interval $[a, b]$ is defined by using a constraint ($a \leq b$). In the case of ill-known intervals, an ill-known constraint is defined.

% \subsection{Interval Evaluation by Ill-known Constraints}
% The problem of interval evaluation is more generally explained in \cite{Pons2011}: the need exists to know if all points in a crisp interval $I$ reside between the boundaries of an ill-known interval $\left[ X , Y \right]$. In \cite{Pons2011}, the notion of an \emph{ill-known constraint} is introduced:
% 
% \begin{definition}
% Given a universe $U$, an ill-known constraint $C$ on a set $A \subseteq U$ is specified by means of a binary relation $R \subseteq U^{2}$ and a fixed, ill-known value denoted by its possibilistic variable $V$ over $U$, i.e.:
% \begin{align}
% C \triangleq (R,V)
% \end{align}
% Set $A$ now satisfies the constraint if and only if:
% \begin{align}
% \forall a \in A : (a,V) \in R
% \end{align}
% \end{definition}
% 
% An example of an ill-known constraint is $C_{ex} \triangleq (<, X)$. Some set $A$ then satisfies $C_{ex}$ if $\forall a \in A : a < X$, given possibilistic variable $X$.
% 
% The satisfaction of a constraint $C \triangleq (R,V)$ by a set $A$ is basically still a Boolean matter, but due to the uncertainty about the ill-known value $V$, it can be uncertain whether $C$ is satisfied by $A$ or not \cite{Pons2011}. In fact, this satisfaction now behaves as a proposition. Based on the possibility distribution $\pi_{V}$ of $V$, the possibility and necessity that $A$ satisfies $C$ can be found. This proposition can thus be seen as a possibilistic variable on $\mathbb{B}$. The required possibility and necessity are:
% 
% \vspace{-10pt}
% 
% \begin{align}
% \Pos(A\text{ satisfies }C) & = \min_{a \in A}\left(\sup_{(a,w) \in R}\pi_{V}(w)\right) \label{ill-known-pos}\\
% \Nec(A\text{ satisfies }C) & = \min_{a \in A}\left(\inf_{(a,w) \notin R} 1-\pi_{V}(w)\right) \label{ill-known-nec}
% \end{align}
% 
% Now, e.g., to check if crisp interval $I = \left[j, k\right]$ is included in $\left[X, Y\right]$, 2 ill-known constraints are constructed:
% 
% \vspace{-10pt}
% 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% C_1 & \triangleq\left(\geq,X\right)\\
% C_2 & \triangleq\left(\leq,Y\right)
% \end{eqnarray}
% 
% To calculate the possibility and necessity concerning a conjunction of constraints, the $\min$ operator can be used. The possibility and necessity of $I$ being included in $\left[X, Y\right]$ are now: 
% 
% \vspace{-10pt}
% 
% \begin{align}
% \label{eq:interval-pos}
% \Pos(I\text{ satisfies }C_1\ and\ C_2) & = \min_{a \in I}\left(\sup_{a \geq w}\pi_{X}(w),\sup_{a \leq v}\pi_{Y}(v)\right)\\
% \label{eq:interval-nec}
% \Nec(I\text{ satisfies }C_1\ and\ C_2) & = \min_{a \in I}\left(\inf_{a < w} 1-\pi_{X}(w),\inf_{a > v} 1-\pi_{Y}(v)\right).
% \end{align}


%TODO: don't forget an example!

%A constraint is a restriction in the values that a given variable can take. An ill-known constraint is a constraint applied on a ill-known value~\cite{Pons2011}. More formally, an ill-known constraint is defined as follows.

%A possibility distribution $\pi_{V}$ is defined on the variable $V$. Then, the  possibility and necessity that $A$ satisfies $C$ is computed by:
%In \cite{Pons2011}, it is shown that the possibility $\Pos(A\text{ sat. }C)$ and the necessity $\Nec(A\text{ sat. }C)$ that $A$ satisfies $C$ can be calculated as follows~\cite{Pons2011}:

%For example, consider an ill-known value $X$ given by a triangular possibility distribution $\left[15, 1, 1\right]$. The ill-known constraint for all the points greater than $X$ is given by $C \triangleq (>, X)$. See Figure \ref{fig:ikc-greater}.

%   \label{fig:ikc-greater}
% \end{figure}

%Several ill-known constraints can now be combined by using the possibilistic extensions of boolean operators `and' ($\wedge$), `or' ($\vee$) and `not' ($\neg$). The possibilities and necessities for these operators are calculated as follows.
